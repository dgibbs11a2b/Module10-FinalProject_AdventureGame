'''\nRiley escapes the Queen, she runs toward the drop ship and she climbs in, leaving the alien nest behind to burn in the flames of the atmospheric meltdown.
She yells out, "Punch it Cardinal! The dropship quickly skyrockets into space and heads for the USCSS Solarus mother ship. After a short flight, they slowly approach the docking
bay and land only to reminisce about the comrades they left behind. Riley takes Rebecca by the hand and they walk down the ramp together in to the main hangar bay of the ship.
She turns to Cardinal and expresses her gratitude by telling him, “You did good”. Cardinal assists corporal Hicks into the medical bay while Riley and Rebecca continue to
their sleeping quarters.

Riley and Rebecca sit down and enjoy a cup of hot chocolate together. She can only imagine what would have happened if she wasn’t
able to rescue her friend from the depths of the Alien nest. She smiles at Rebecca and Rebecca asks her,“Are we going to sleep all the way home?”
Riley replies, “…all the way home”. Rebecca says, “Can I dream?, Riley softly replies, “I think we both can.”

Riley and Rebecca settle in to the cryochamber for the long journey home. Riley closes her eyes and she is happy.

'''\nRiley abandons the Alien nest, and her friend Rebecca. She runs toward the drop ship and she climbs in.
The dropship quickly skyrockets into space and heads for the USCSS Solarus mother ship. After a short flight, they slowly approach the docking
bay and land only to reminisce about the comrades they left behind. Riley walks down the ramp and she turns to Cardinal expressing her disappointment to abandon the mission. Cardinal, drops his head and
turns to walk away while he accompanies Corporal Hicks into the medical bay.

Riley goes to her quarters and falls down on her bed clutching her face as she realizes that she missed the opportunity
to rescue her friend. We will never know the outcome of Rileys actions however, the Alien Queen, all of the alien creatures have been destroyed. Riley sits up on her bed and stares out the ships window
in the distance. She sees planet FURY161 and a huge atomic cloud as it proliferates the atmosphere. She has failed and her friend Rebecca who has perished in the explosion. Riley, feeling lost and sadenned
at her choice to leave, slowly gets up, walks over to the cryochamber, and settles in for the long journey home. She closes her eyes and reminisces about her relationship with her friend and the sadness overcomes her.

She falls asleep in regret.
