Game: The Alien Adventure

An introduction to the project:

This game is based on the movie Aliens, starring Sigourney Weaver. This is my all-time favorite movie. The game is based on the rescue operation that takes place in the last 30 minutes of the movie with Ripley's character descending into the depths of the Alien nest to rescue her friend Newt (Rebecca Jordan). Details of the game have been modified and are not always specific to the content of the movie in order to account for time. (We only have five chapters to program in our assignment). However, if you watch the last 30 minutes of this movie, you will see that the details are pretty much the same. I decided to program this adventure game because I saw an opportunity for adding while loops to construct and execute a lot of the decision making that would guide this character throughout her adventure.
Here is some game background information so you know who you are working with (Trust me, she's one bad chick!)
Story genre: Science Fiction

Location: USCSS Solarus in space and Planet FURY-161

Character background (player): Lieutenant Helen Riley (1st Class)  

The Story:

Formerly assigned to the USCSS Nostradamus, an M-Class Star freighter touched down on FURY-161 to home in a on a distress beacon from a derelict spacecraft. Helen and her team discover that the spacecraft belong to a dangerous alien species. The alien creature invades her and her team's ship, eliminating each member one by one. Helen must abandon the ship before becoming its final victim. After destroying the star freighter, and the alien creature, she seeks refuge in a lifeboat and drifts through space for 57 years in hyper sleep until finally being rescued by a salvage team. 

It is now the year 2102. The once desolate planet, FURY161, now home to a
terraforming colony with 75 families. Surrounding the base are large atmospheric processors to help make the air breathable for its inhabitants. The recent silence from
the colony is un-nerving. No one has been able to contact these families for weeks.
Riley, last survivor of the Nostradamus incident from years past and an employee of
the Weyland Markham corporation goes through the company debriefing and goes back to her quarters to unwind. 

Riley receives the news of the latest loss of communications an is asked by the company to accompany the team of specially trained marines to travel down to the planet and establish contact with the colony. Once on the planet, they discover that the entire colony has disappeared and, in their attempts, to search for any survivors, they encounter an alien species which totally wipes out the majority of their team. now she must make a choice to leave the planet with the remaining survivors, Corporal Hicks, and Cardinal the android, or travel deep into the Alien nest to locate the only remaining survivor, Rebecca, a young girl that Riley had befriended during the initial visit. 

During the battle on FURY-161, Riley and Rebecca became separated and Rebecca has now been taken by the alien creatures soon to be made a host for creating new alien creatures.
This is a text-based adventure game. You have assumed the role of the main character in the game, LT. Helen Riley. Every choice you make will determine Riley's actions and the plot's outcome.
Good luck! I hope you enjoy the game.
